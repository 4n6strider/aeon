# Installation

Installing Aeon is really easy: [find the latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/leinelissen/aeon/releases/latest), and download the right package for your architecture. At this moment the following operating systems are supported.

* Windows (with setup.exe or with NuGet: .nupkg)
* macOS (the darwin .zip)
* Ubuntu / Debian (the .deb file)
* Fedora / CentOS / RHEL (the .rpm file)

If you find a platform you are regularly using missing, please create an issue, or find our guide to compiling your own version. ARM is theoretically supported, but please do report any issues you encounter while trying to do so.
