                        <p>Aeon will gather data from the service you have provided your credentials for. Let's get your first batch of data.</p>

                        <p>All right! You retrieved your first pieces of data. This process will happen in the background from now on. This means that occasionally, you may get a pop-up to enter your credentials. This is to check for updates to your data. If you want to know any update status, find the bar on the bottom.</p>
                        <p>Before we dive in, there's another type of data we need to tell you about. We just retrieved all the data you can normally access. However, services may save additional data to which you have no direct access (such as IP addresses). We can access this data through starting a <i>data request</i>.</p>
                        <p>Note: you may receive an email about this. This is normal.</p>
